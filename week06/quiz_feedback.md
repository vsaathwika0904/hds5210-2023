# Week 4 Feedback
Like your weekly assignments, your feedback on this quiz is provided as `quiz_feedback.md` in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

A big reason for doing this quiz during class was to see what you are able to do one your own without talking to other students. I gave clear instructions that you were NOT to collaborate with others and that the work you submit was to be your own.  If you used ChatGPT or another resource and clearly copied and pasted that work, you will lose all of the points for the first part of this quiz.

## Final Score: 5/20

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* All code worked as expected

## Fill in the blank:
_Did you answer the data type questions correctly?_
* All data types questions were answered correctly

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
# Plagarism Check

As per our discussions in class and the university's [academic integrity policy](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/42884/assignments/syllabus#:~:text=Academic%20Integrity%3A%C2%A0) you may use ChatGPT to help you understand how to solve problems in the class, but you may not copy and paste or directly copy from online resources like ChatGPT, Redit, StackExchange, or anywhere else.  You are required in this class to learn the material, understand how to write code that will satisfy the assignments, and write your own original code.

Based on a similarity check between your submitted work and the solution produced by ChatGPT or by other students. It appears that you mostly copied the solution provided by ChatGPT, mostly copied another student's work, or let another student copy your work.  

It is very unlikely that you typed the same description using the same sentences, used the same variable names, and followed the exact same approach as ChatGPT or other students.

**You will only earn a maximum of 5 points**


# Quality and Completeness

The code provided by ChatGPT and consequently the code you submitted for this quiz did not include all of the required documentation and docstring tests:
* **(-10 from base) You did not have any docstrings**

> For full credit, your code must satisfy all of the following requirements:
> 1. Pass all of the assert tests provided below
> 2. Have a docstring with parameter types, function description, and at least 5 test cases that cover a range of inputs and outputs
> 3. Successfully run all 5 tests when the *run_docstring_examples* cell is called
> 4. Implement the rules above completely, even if a test scenario is not represented in the asserts or docstrings
